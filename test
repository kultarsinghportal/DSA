One-Pager: Salesforce Task Requirements – Permissions
________________________________________
Title: Salesforce Task Requirements - Permission Model
________________________________________
Task 1: Inherited Task Visibility from CM Exposure
Teams Involved (Trading Desks):
1.	Trading:
o	Members: Tr-Mgr, Tr-01, Tr-02, Tr-03
2.	Structuring:
o	Members: Str-Mgr, Str-01, Str-02, Str-03
3.	Portfolio Monitoring:
o	Members: PM-Mgr, PM-01, PM-02, PM-03
Custom Object: CM Exposure
•	Access Control: Permissions for CM Exposure records are managed via the API. The API creates entries in the CM Exposure Share Table to handle record-level security.
•	Visibility Requirement: When a CM Exposure record is created, only specific members from the teams have access to it. For example:
CM Exposure 1 – Permitted Users: Tr-Mgr, Tr-01, Str-Mgr, Str-01, Str-02, PM-Mgr
Requirement for Task Assignment:
•	If Tr-01 creates a task under CM Exposure 1 and assigns it to the Structuring Queue (which includes all Structuring team members: Str-Mgr, Str-01, Str-02, Str-03), only those with permissions to the parent CM Exposure 1 should have access to the task.
o	Current Salesforce Behavior: When a task is assigned to a queue, all queue members get access.
o	Requirement: The task should inherit the visibility model from the parent CM Exposure object, meaning only the permitted users (Tr-Mgr, Tr-01, Str-Mgr, Str-01, Str-02, PM-Mgr) should have access, not all queue members.
Key Objective: Ensure that task visibility is limited to users permitted in the CM Exposure record, even when assigned to a team queue.

Task 2: Manager-Assigned Task Ownership and Visibility
Requirement for Task Ownership:
•	When a manager, such as Str-Mgr, assigns a task to a team member (e.g., Str-02), the task should include an Owner Field indicating who is responsible for working on the task.
o	Example: If Str-Mgr assigns a task to Str-02, it should be clear that Str-02 is the current task owner, while still indicating that the task belongs to the Structuring team.
Visibility and Edit Access:
•	Any user who inherits visibility from the parent CM Exposure object should be able to:
o	View which team the task is currently assigned to (e.g., Structuring).
o	View which specific team member (if any) is currently working on the task (e.g., Str-02).
o	View and edit the task status.
Edit Permissions:
•	Any user with the right to view and edit the task should be able to amend the task's details, including updating the task status.
o	Fallback Scenario: If the task owner (e.g., Str-02) is unavailable, another permitted user should be able to make updates or amendments to ensure task progress is not blocked.

Summary of Requirements
1.	Task 1: The visibility model for tasks must be inherited from the parent CM Exposure object, restricting access to only those who have permission to view the parent record, even when assigned to a queue.
2.	Task 2: Tasks assigned within a team should have an Owner Field indicating the current worker, and any user with inherited visibility can view, edit, and update the task as needed.
This setup ensures proper visibility inheritance, task ownership clarity, and flexibility in task management, even if the primary assignee is unavailable.
Task 3: Task View Filtration Criteria
For the Task View, the following filtering options should be available to help users quickly locate and manage tasks. These filters will enhance visibility and prioritization based on user roles, ownership, and timelines.
________________________________________
Filtration Criteria:
1.	Tasks (All):
o	Description: Displays all tasks, irrespective of team or ownership. This gives a global overview of all tasks, including both assigned and unassigned tasks.
o	Use Case: Useful for managers or users who need visibility into the entire workflow or pipeline.
2.	Tasks (My Team):
o	Description: Shows all tasks assigned to the user’s team. This includes tasks assigned to any member of the team (e.g., if you are in Structuring, you'll see tasks for Str-Mgr, Str-01, Str-02, Str-03).
o	Use Case: Team-level visibility to understand what tasks are in progress and who in the team is responsible.
3.	Tasks (My Team) 7 Days:
o	Description: Displays tasks for the user's team that are due within the next 7 days. This helps prioritize tasks based on urgency.
o	Use Case: Team leads and managers can use this view to track upcoming deadlines and ensure timely completion of tasks.
4.	Tasks (My Team) 7 Days (No Owner):
o	Description: Shows tasks for the user’s team that are due within 7 days but currently do not have an assigned owner. These tasks need to be prioritized and assigned to team members.
o	Use Case: Managers and team leads can identify unassigned tasks that require ownership to ensure they are not missed.
5.	Tasks (For Me):
o	Description: Filters tasks that are specifically assigned to the user. This view helps individuals focus on their personal workload and responsibilities.
o	Use Case: Users can easily see all tasks they are responsible for completing.
6.	Tasks (For Me) 7 Days:
o	Description: Shows tasks assigned to the user that are due within the next 7 days. This helps users prioritize tasks based on upcoming deadlines.
o	Use Case: Personal task management, allowing users to focus on urgent tasks that need to be completed soon.

Summary of Task View Filters:
•	Tasks (All): Global task visibility across all teams.
•	Tasks (My Team): Tasks for the entire team.
•	Tasks (My Team) 7 Days: Team tasks due in the next 7 days.
•	Tasks (My Team) 7 Days (No Owner): Unassigned team tasks due within the next 7 days.
•	Tasks (For Me): Tasks assigned directly to the user.
•	Tasks (For Me) 7 Days: User’s tasks due in the next 7 days.
This filtration system ensures that both individuals and team managers can stay organized, prioritize their workload, and address critical tasks that are nearing deadlines or currently unassigned.
