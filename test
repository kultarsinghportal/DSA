Each of these APIs serves different needs and use cases, making Salesforce a highly adaptable and integrable platform. Depending on your specific requirements—whether it's integrating Salesforce data with other applications, automating Salesforce configurations, or building custom user interfaces—there's likely a Salesforce API that fits the bill.

The Salesforce Records REST API, part of the broader Salesforce REST API, enables developers to manage Salesforce records directly through HTTP requests. This API focuses on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and querying records using Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) queries, making it a powerful tool for integrating external applications with Salesforce data. Here's an overview of its key features and capabilities:

CRUD Operations
Create: Allows you to insert new records into Salesforce objects. You specify the object type (e.g., Account, Contact) and provide field values in the request body as JSON.

Read: Enables the retrieval of specific records by their ID or querying multiple records based on criteria. It supports direct record access using the record ID and querying using SOQL.

Update: You can modify existing records by specifying their ID and providing new field values in the request body. It supports partial updates, allowing you to update only the fields that need to be changed.

Delete: Allows for the deletion of records by their ID, removing them from the Salesforce database.

Querying
SOQL Queries: You can execute SOQL queries to retrieve records that match specified criteria. This is useful for fetching records with complex filtering, sorting, and pagination.
Special Operations
Upsert: A combination of "update" and "insert", allowing you to update existing records based on an external ID field or insert new ones if they don't exist. This operation is especially useful for integrating with external systems.

Describe: Retrieve metadata about Salesforce objects, including information about object fields, relationships, and permissions. This is crucial for dynamically interacting with Salesforce data structures.

Using the API
The Salesforce Records REST API is accessed via endpoint URLs structured as follows:

Base URL: https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/
API version: vXX.0/ (e.g., v52.0)
Resource path: For example, sobjects/Account/ for accounts or query/ for SOQL queries.
Authentication
Access to the Salesforce REST API requires authentication using Salesforce's OAuth 2.0 implementation. Clients must obtain an access token and include it in the Authorization header of HTTP requests.

Benefits and Use Cases
Integration: Seamlessly integrate external applications with Salesforce, enabling bidirectional data flow.
Automation: Automate data entry, updates, and deletion, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.
Custom Applications: Build custom applications that interact with Salesforce data, providing tailored UIs or functionality beyond what's available in Salesforce itself.
Limitations and Considerations
API Limits: Salesforce imposes limits on API requests, which vary by edition and licensing. It's essential to monitor API usage to avoid exceeding these limits.
Data Security: Ensure that your application adheres to Salesforce's security guidelines, particularly regarding data access and manipulation.
The Salesforce Records REST API is a key component of Salesforce's API offerings, enabling developers to work with Salesforce data in a straightforward and flexible manner. Its support for CRUD operations, combined with the power of SOQL for data retrieval, makes it an invaluable tool for a wide range of integration and automation tasks.
Salesforce's Records REST API allows you to manage Salesforce records directly using HTTP methods. This API is part of the broader Salesforce REST API and enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on records within Salesforce. Below, I'll outline some working examples to illustrate how you can use the Records REST API for various operations. These examples assume that you have authenticated with Salesforce and have obtained an access token.

1. Create a New Record
To create a new record, such as a Contact, you would send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint. Here's an example using cURL:

bash
Copy code
curl https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "FirstName": "Jane",
    "LastName": "Doe",
    "Email": "janedoe@example.com"
  }'
In this example, replace yourInstance with your Salesforce instance's domain, vXX.0 with the API version you are using (e.g., v52.0), and your_access_token with the access token you've obtained from Salesforce.

2. Retrieve a Record
To retrieve a specific record by its ID, you can use a GET request. For example, to retrieve a Contact:

bash
Copy code
curl https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/recordId \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"
Replace recordId with the actual ID of the Contact you wish to retrieve.

3. Update a Record
To update an existing record, you send a PATCH request with the new data. Here's how you might update a Contact's email address:

bash
Copy code
curl -X PATCH https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/recordId \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Email": "newemail@example.com"
  }'
Again, replace recordId with the ID of the Contact you are updating.

4. Delete a Record
To delete a record, you would use a DELETE request. Here's how to delete a Contact:

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/recordId \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"
5. Query Records
You can also use the REST API to query records using SOQL. Here's an example of querying for Contacts:

bash
Copy code
curl https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.0/query/?q=SELECT+FirstName,LastName,Email+FROM+Contact \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"
These examples demonstrate basic operations with the Salesforce Records REST API. The actual implementation in a real-world scenario would need to handle errors, pagination for queries returning many records, and more nuanced aspects of working with Salesforce data types and relationships.


Prerequisites
Salesforce Account: Ensure you have access to a Salesforce account and the necessary permissions to create records.
Connected App: Set up a Connected App in Salesforce for OAuth authentication.
Consumer Key and Consumer Secret: Obtain from your Connected App setup.
Username and Password: Salesforce login credentials.
Security Token: Your Salesforce security token. This is required if your organization restricts IP addresses or you're accessing Salesforce from an unrecognized IP.

A Connected App in Salesforce is a framework that allows external applications to integrate with Salesforce using APIs. It serves as a bridge between Salesforce and third-party applications, enabling them to authenticate, access, and manipulate Salesforce data according to the defined permissions. Connected Apps use standard OAuth protocols for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to Salesforce resources.

Key Features of Connected Apps
OAuth for Authentication and Authorization: Connected Apps use OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing users to securely authorize external applications without exposing their credentials.

API Access: They provide API access to Salesforce data, making it possible for external applications to perform operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Salesforce records.

Scoped Permissions: Developers can define the scope of access for Connected Apps, restricting them to only the necessary data and actions needed for the application to function.

Identity Services: Connected Apps can also use Salesforce as an identity provider, allowing users to log in to external applications using their Salesforce credentials.

How to Create a Connected App in Salesforce
Creating a Connected App involves a few steps within the Salesforce setup menu. Here's a simplified overview:

Log into Salesforce: Use your administrator account to log into Salesforce.

Navigate to App Manager: From the Setup menu, navigate to the App Manager. This is typically found under the "Apps" section in "Platform Tools".

Create New Connected App: Click on the "New Connected App" button. You'll be prompted to fill in details such as the app name, API (Enable OAuth Settings), contact email, and other information.

Configure OAuth Settings: This is crucial. You'll need to specify the callback URL (where Salesforce redirects users after authentication), and select the OAuth scopes (permissions) that control what the app can access. This is where you define what your application is allowed to do on behalf of the user, like accessing user data or performing actions.

Save and Manage Your App: Once you've configured your app, save it. Salesforce then provides a consumer key (client ID) and consumer secret (client secret) that your external application will use to authenticate.

Security Considerations
When using Connected Apps, it's important to follow best practices for security, especially regarding the handling of OAuth tokens and the selection of scopes. Limit the permissions to what's strictly necessary for the application to function to minimize potential security risks.

Conclusion
Connected Apps are a powerful tool for integrating Salesforce with external platforms, enabling businesses to extend their Salesforce capabilities beyond the CRM. By leveraging OAuth for secure authentication and providing flexible API access, Connected Apps facilitate a wide range of integrations, from simple data synchronization tasks to complex business applications.

To obtain the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret for your Connected App in Salesforce, you need to have already created a Connected App within your Salesforce environment. These details are generated by Salesforce when the app is created and are crucial for authenticating and authorizing your application to access Salesforce data via the API. Here's how you can find these credentials:

Step 1: Log into Salesforce
Access your Salesforce org where the Connected App was created. You'll need to have administrative access or the necessary permissions to view the App Manager.

Step 2: Navigate to App Manager
From the Setup menu, find the "Apps" section, which is usually under "Platform Tools". Click on "App Manager".

Step 3: Locate Your Connected App
In the App Manager, look for your Connected App by name. You can use the search function if you have many apps.

Step 4: View the Connected App
Click on the dropdown menu next to your app's name and select "View". This will take you to the Connected App's details page.

Step 5: Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
On the Connected App detail page, you will find the Consumer Key listed. For security reasons, the Consumer Secret is not immediately visible. There should be a button or link to reveal or reset the Consumer Secret. You might need to click "Click to reveal" or a similar option to view the Consumer Secret.

Important Notes:
Security: The Consumer Secret is sensitive information. Treat it like a password and keep it secure. Do not share it unnecessarily or store it in insecure places.
Resetting the Consumer Secret: If you believe the Consumer Secret has been compromised or if you've lost it, you can reset it from the Connected App details page. Be aware that resetting the Consumer Secret can disrupt any existing integrations that use the current secret until they are updated with the new one.
Permissions and Access: Make sure your Connected App is configured with the appropriate OAuth scopes (permissions) for your use case. This defines what your application can do once authenticated.
Remember, the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret are used to authenticate your external application with Salesforce via the OAuth 2.0 protocol. They are essential for establishing a secure connection between your application and Salesforce, enabling API access and data manipulation based on the defined permissions.

Fetching the Consumer Secret programmatically for your Salesforce Connected App is not directly supported by Salesforce for security reasons. The Consumer Secret acts like a password for your application, and allowing it to be retrieved programmatically would pose a significant security risk. Therefore, Salesforce does not provide an API or method to fetch the Consumer Secret automatically.

When setting up an external application to interact with Salesforce, the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret are manually obtained from the Salesforce UI during the setup process of your Connected App. These credentials should then be securely stored and used by your application to authenticate with Salesforce via OAuth 2.0.

Best Practices for Managing Consumer Keys and Secrets:
Secure Storage: Store your Consumer Secret securely. This can be done using environment variables, encrypted configuration files, or secrets management tools and services that provide encryption and access control.

Environment Separation: Keep separate keys and secrets for development, testing, and production environments to reduce the risk of exposure.

Access Control: Ensure that only authorized personnel or systems have access to these credentials. Use roles and permissions within your team or organization to control access.

Audit and Rotate Secrets: Regularly audit your credentials and rotate them periodically to minimize the risk of unauthorized use. Remember to update your application with the new credentials after rotation.

Automate Credential Injection: For applications deployed in cloud environments or using CI/CD pipelines, consider using services that inject credentials into your application's environment at runtime. This way, credentials are not stored within the application's source code or configuration files.

Implementing Secure Access in Your Application:
When your application needs to authenticate with Salesforce, it should use the Consumer Key and Secret to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token. This is typically done as part of your application's startup process or during the first API call. The steps generally involve:

Sending a request to the Salesforce OAuth endpoint with your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, and other required OAuth parameters.
Salesforce validates your application's credentials and returns an access token.
Your application uses this access token for subsequent API calls.
Ensure your application's code securely handles these credentials and access tokens, avoiding logging them in plain text or exposing them through insecure connections.

In summary, while you cannot programmatically fetch the Consumer Secret from Salesforce for your Connected App, following best practices for secure credential management can help maintain the security of your Salesforce integration.

The Salesforce REST API provides a powerful and flexible way to interact with Salesforce data. It supports a wide range of operations on records, which can be categorized under CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and more. Here are the various REST record operations available:

1. Create
POST Request: Create new records in Salesforce by sending a POST request to the appropriate object endpoint. You must include the record data in the request body.
2. Read
GET Request: Retrieve record details by sending a GET request to the object's endpoint, specifying the record ID. Salesforce also supports query operations using SOQL in a GET request to fetch records that meet certain criteria.
3. Update
PATCH Request: Update existing records by sending a PATCH request with the updated data in the request body to the endpoint that includes the record ID.
4. Delete
DELETE Request: Delete records by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint specifying the record ID.
5. Query
Query with SOQL: Execute a SOQL query to retrieve records that match specified criteria by sending a GET request to the query endpoint. This is useful for fetching multiple records based on complex filtering.
6. Search
Search with SOSL: Perform a text-based search across multiple objects by sending a GET request with a SOSL query. This allows for searching records across the organization.
7. Describe
Metadata Describe: Retrieve metadata about objects and fields in your organization by sending a GET request to the describe endpoint. This is useful for understanding object schemas and available fields.
8. Upsert
PATCH Request: Insert a new record or update an existing record based on an external ID. This operation is a combination of insert and update, which is determined based on whether an existing record with the specified external ID is found.
9. Retrieve Multiple Records by IDs
GET Request: Retrieve details of multiple records by their IDs in a single request. This is efficient for fetching a specific set of records without using SOQL queries.
10. Recent Records
GET Request: Access a list of recently viewed or modified records. This is useful for displaying recent activity or changes.
11. Approval Processes
POST Request: Submit records for approval or work with approval processes programmatically. This allows for managing approval workflows within external applications.

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) and SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) are two powerful querying languages provided by Salesforce to query and search your organization's Salesforce data. Both languages allow you to programmatically search for and access data stored in Salesforce, but they are designed for different use cases and operate in distinct ways.

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)
Purpose: SOQL is used to query specific information from your organization’s Salesforce data based on specified criteria. It allows you to search for specific records, fields, and relationships between objects. SOQL queries return data from a single object or from multiple objects that are related to one another.

The Salesforce REST API provides two powerful operations related to the structure and manipulation of Salesforce objects and records: "Describe" and "Upsert". These operations offer flexibility in handling metadata and managing data, respectively.

Describe Operation
The Describe operation is used to retrieve metadata about Salesforce objects and their fields, relationships, and permissions. This metadata can inform clients about the structure of Salesforce data, helping to dynamically adapt to changes in Salesforce object definitions without hard-coding object schemas.

Key Features:
Retrieves metadata about an object, such as fields, record type info, URLs, and more.
Helps understand object capabilities (e.g., if it supports CRUD operations).
Essential for dynamic client applications that need to adapt to different Salesforce configurations.
REST API Example:
http
Copy code
GET /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Account/describe/
Method: GET
Endpoint: /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/ObjectName/describe/
Replace ObjectName with the name of the Salesforce object, such as Account, Contact, etc., and vXX.0 with the API version.
Usage:
A GET request to this endpoint returns detailed metadata about the object. This operation is particularly useful for building UIs dynamically or when you need to ensure your application respects the object's permissions and structure.

Upsert Operation
The Upsert operation combines "Update" and "Insert" functionalities. It allows you to update an existing record if it exists, or insert a new record if it does not, based on an external ID field defined on the object. This is particularly useful for integrating external systems with Salesforce where you might not know if the record already exists in Salesforce.

Key Features:
Reduces the need for separate queries to check for record existence.
Simplifies data synchronization tasks between Salesforce and external systems.
Uses an external ID field to determine record uniqueness.
REST API Example:
http
Copy code
PATCH /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Account/ExternalIdField__c/externalIdValue
Method: PATCH
Endpoint: /services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/ObjectName/ExternalIdFieldName/externalId
Replace ObjectName with the Salesforce object type, ExternalIdFieldName with the field name of the external ID on that object, externalId with the value of the external ID, and vXX.0 with the API version.
Payload Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "Name": "Acme",
  "Phone": "123-456-7890"
}
Usage:
A PATCH request to this endpoint either updates the record matching the provided external ID with the given field values or inserts a new record with those values if no match is found. This operation is key for efficient data integration, allowing for seamless upserts based on unique identifiers that exist outside of Salesforce.

Both "Describe" and "Upsert" operations play crucial roles in Salesforce integration and application development, offering insights into object metadata and simplifying data management tasks.

Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where you know which objects your data resides in and you want to retrieve data from single or multiple related objects. For example, retrieving all Contacts related to a specific Account.

Syntax Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, TotalOpportunityQuantity FROM Account WHERE Name = 'Acme'
Characteristics:

Retrieves data from one or more related objects.
Uses a SELECT statement to specify the fields you want to retrieve.
Includes FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and other clauses to refine your query.
Strongly resembles SQL (Structured Query Language) in syntax and functionality.
SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language)
Purpose: SOSL is designed to search across multiple objects simultaneously, making it particularly useful for global searches across large datasets. It can find data within fields by matching a search query string. SOSL queries can return sets of data from different objects.

Use Case: Ideal for search scenarios where you don't know which object or field contains the data, or when you need to perform a broad search across multiple objects. For example, searching for a text string across multiple objects like Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities simultaneously.

Syntax Example:

sql
Copy code
FIND {Acme} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account(Id, Name), Contact(Id, Name), Opportunity(Id, Name)
Characteristics:

Capable of searching across multiple objects at once.
Uses a FIND statement with a search string.
Allows specifying which objects and fields to return in the search results.
More flexible for broad searches but may be less precise than SOQL for specific data retrieval tasks.
Choosing Between SOQL and SOSL
SOQL is more suited to precise queries where you know the structure of the data, need data from specific objects, or want to leverage complex relationships and filtering.

SOSL is better for global search scenarios where the exact location of data is unknown, or you need to perform a quick search across several objects and fields.

In practice, Salesforce developers often use both languages in conjunction, selecting the one that best fits the requirements of each specific data access or search task.


To create a Salesforce record using the Salesforce REST API from a C# application, you'll need to follow these steps:

Authenticate with Salesforce to obtain an access token.
Use the access token to make a POST request to the Salesforce REST API to create a record.
Below is a simplified C# example that demonstrates these steps. This example assumes you have already set up a Connected App in Salesforce to get the consumerKey, consumerSecret, and you have the user's username and password along with the securityToken.

Step 1: Authentication to Obtain Access Token
First, you'll need to authenticate with Salesforce to obtain an access token. Salesforce uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public class SalesforceAuth
{
    public string InstanceUrl { get; set; }
    public string AccessToken { get; set; }

    public async Task AuthenticateAsync(string consumerKey, string consumerSecret, string username, string password, string securityToken)
    {
        var loginEndpoint = "https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token";
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();

        var requestContent = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[]
        {
            new KeyValuePair<string, string>("grant_type", "password"),
            new KeyValuePair<string, string>("client_id", consumerKey),
            new KeyValuePair<string, string>("client_secret", consumerSecret),
            new KeyValuePair<string, string>("username", username),
            new KeyValuePair<string, string>("password", password + securityToken)
        });

        var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(loginEndpoint, requestContent);
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            string json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            dynamic result = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json);
            InstanceUrl = result.instance_url;
            AccessToken = result.access_token;
        }
        else
        {
            throw new Exception("Authentication failed.");
        }
    }
}
Step 2: Creating a Record
After obtaining the access token, you can use it to create a record in Salesforce. Here's an example of creating a Contact record:

csharp
Copy code
public class SalesforceApi
{
    private readonly SalesforceAuth _salesforceAuth;

    public SalesforceApi(SalesforceAuth salesforceAuth)
    {
        _salesforceAuth = salesforceAuth;
    }

    public async Task CreateContactAsync(string firstName, string lastName, string email)
    {
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", _salesforceAuth.AccessToken);
        httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

        var contactData = new
        {
            FirstName = firstName,
            LastName = lastName,
            Email = email
        };

        var jsonContent = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(contactData);
        var content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

        var response = await httpClient.PostAsync($"{_salesforceAuth.InstanceUrl}/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/", content);

        if (!response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            throw new Exception($"Failed to create contact: {responseContent}");
        }
    }
}

json
Copy code
{
  "FirstName": "John",
  "LastName": "Smith",
  "Email": "john.smith@example.com"
}
This JSON payload is included in the body of a POST request directed at the Salesforce REST API's endpoint for record creation (/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/). Here, FirstName, LastName, and Email are fields within the Contact object that you are populating with new data.

son
Copy code
{
  "id": "003xx000004TmiQAAS",
  "success": true,
  "errors": []
}
id: The unique identifier for the newly created Contact record.
success: A boolean value indicating whether the creation was successful.
errors: An array of error messages, if any were encountered during the creation process. This array is empty if the operation was successful.

Usage
To use the above classes to authenticate and create a contact in Salesforce:

csharp
Copy code
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    var consumerKey = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY";
    var consumerSecret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET";
    var username = "YOUR_USERNAME";
    var password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
    var securityToken = "YOUR_SECURITY_TOKEN";

    var salesforceAuth = new SalesforceAuth();
    await salesforceAuth.AuthenticateAsync(consumerKey, consumerSecret, username, password, securityToken);

    var salesforceApi = new SalesforceApi(salesforceAuth);
    await salesforceApi.CreateContactAsync("Jane", "Doe", "jane.doe@example.com");
}
This example demonstrates the basic flow of authenticating with Salesforce and creating a record. You will need to replace placeholder strings with your actual Salesforce credentials and Connected App details. Additionally, ensure you have the Newtonsoft.Json package installed in your project for JSON serialization and deserialization.

Retrieve a Record
To retrieve a Salesforce record by its ID, you can make a GET request to the record's URL.

csharp
Copy code
public async Task<string> RetrieveContactAsync(string contactId)
{
    var httpClient = new HttpClient();
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", _salesforceAuth.AccessToken);
    
    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync($"{_salesforceAuth.InstanceUrl}/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/{contactId}");

    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var jsonResult = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        return jsonResult; // JSON string of the contact record
    }
    else
    {
        throw new Exception("Failed to retrieve contact.");
    }
}

JSON Response Payload upon Successful Retrieval
When you successfully retrieve the record, Salesforce returns a JSON response that includes the fields of the Contact record. Here's an example of what the response might look like:

json
Copy code
{
  "Id": "003xx000004TmiQAAS",
  "FirstName": "John",
  "LastName": "Smith",
  "Email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "Phone": "123-456-7890",
  "attributes": {
    "type": "Contact",
    "url": "/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/003xx000004TmiQAAS"
  }
}
Each key-value pair represents a field and its value in the Contact record.
The attributes object includes metadata about the record, such as its type (Contact) and a relative URL to the record itself.
Update a Record
Updating a record is similar to creating one, but you use a PATCH request and include the record ID in the URL.

csharp
Copy code
public async Task UpdateContactAsync(string contactId, string newEmail)
{
    var httpClient = new HttpClient();
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", _salesforceAuth.AccessToken);

    var updateData = new { Email = newEmail };
    var jsonContent = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(updateData);
    var content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

    var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(new HttpMethod("PATCH"), $"{_salesforceAuth.InstanceUrl}/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Contact/{contactId}")
    {
        Content = content
    };

    var response = await httpClient.SendAsync(requestMessage);

    if (!response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        throw new Exception("Failed to update contact.");
    }
}
Delete a Record
Deleting a record involves sending a DELETE request with the record's ID.

csharp
Copy code
public async Task DeleteContactAsync(string contactId)
{

Usage
These methods would be part of your SalesforceApi class and used similarly to the create method, ensuring that the SalesforceAuth instance has been authenticated:

csharp
Copy code
// Assuming salesforceAuth is already authenticated
var salesforceApi = new SalesforceApi(salesforceAuth);

// Retrieve a contact
string contactId = "YOUR_CONTACT_ID";
var contactJson = await salesforceApi.RetrieveContactAsync(contactId);
Console.WriteLine(contactJson);

// Update a contact's email
await salesforceApi.UpdateContactAsync(contactId, "newemail@example.com");

// Delete a contact
await salesforceApi.DeleteContactAsync(contactId);
Ensure to replace "YOUR_CONTACT_ID" with the actual ID of a contact record in your Salesforce org. These examples illustrate basic operations to manage Salesforce records via the REST API using C#. Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in a real-world application, especially for network requests and API limits.
