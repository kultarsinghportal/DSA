I am a Software Engineer with experience in software development, currently working in the capital markets sector. I previously worked at EFI, where I gained valuable skills in software engineering. I have completed the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree from Udacity, acquiring expertise in:

AWS Cloud Fundamentals: Proficient in AWS services like EC2, RDS, S3, and IAM, with a solid understanding of cloud computing concepts and security.
Infrastructure as Code (IAC): Skilled in deploying resources using AWS CloudFormation and managing networking and database services.
Microservices and Kubernetes: Experienced in building scalable architectures with Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS Lambda.
CI/CD Pipelines: Adept in establishing automation and monitoring through continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions.
This skill set positions me to contribute to the exploration and future implementation of cloud-based solutions within the capital markets sector.
